# Contributing to RSTS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with GitHub

This project uses GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as
well as accept pull requests.

## Use Github Flow

We Use [Github
Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).
All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested:
   - Add tests.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 license

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [Apache License version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/)
that covers the project.

## Report bugs using [issues](https://github.com/TerryEbdon/RSTS/issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/TerryEbdon/RSTS/issues); it's
that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A short summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Two spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- English is the preferred language for all comments, issues, commits, pull
  requests and other communications. Spelling and grammar should use British or
  Irish conventions where possible.
